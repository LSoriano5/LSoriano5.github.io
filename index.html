    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Currently a student at OSU majoring in Computer Science. I have obtained a BS in Health Science from Cal State Channel Islands. I have worked in different settings ranging from a medical office working as a physical therapy technician, served in fine dining, and currently working at a brewery serving and helping plan events for them. With everything that I have done in a work setting has prepared me for any scenario or environment I put myself in. 

    Some projects that I have done over the years was that I have managed a flu shot clinic for my University. Organized nursing students to give these shots to university students and family members at no cost totaling to 2500 shots. I have also organized events for a brewery by promoting the brand and building events to bring the community together. </p>
